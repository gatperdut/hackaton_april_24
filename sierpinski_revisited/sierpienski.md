##### Sierpinski

If you remember, some months back we did a fractal-related hackaton by drawing a Sierpinski triangle, up to an arbitrary depth level.

Can you do the same by drawing only dots, i.e., no lines?

You might want to google this up, as the procedure itself is extremely simple, but very unintuitive.
